# Type-Scribe AI: Agentic TypeScript SDK Generator ü§ñ‚ú®


Welcome to **Type-Scribe AI**! This project showcases an intelligent agent system designed to automate the creation of TypeScript API SDKs directly from existing API documentation (such as READMEs or website docs). Our aim is to significantly reduce the manual effort and potential for errors developers face when integrating with new APIs, providing a streamlined and rapid SDK generation process.

This repository (`type-scribe-ai-submission`) contains the complete codebase for the Type-Scribe AI project, organized into `frontend` and `backend` sub-folders.

## Overview of the Idea üí°

Type-Scribe AI is an intelligent agent system designed to automate the creation of TypeScript API SDKs directly from existing API documentation (such as READMEs or website docs). This project aims to significantly reduce the manual effort and potential for errors developers face when integrating with new APIs, providing a streamlined and rapid SDK generation process.

## Project Goal üéØ

To demonstrate a functional AI agent system that can intelligently:
1.  Ingest unstructured API documentation.
2.  Parse and understand API endpoints, request/response structures, and data types.
3.  Orchestrate multiple agents to generate a basic, usable TypeScript SDK.

The project emphasizes practical application of multi-agent orchestration and advanced LLM capabilities to solve a common developer pain point.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The system is built around a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by Agno, with a user-friendly frontend and robust backend.

### User Flow üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1.  The user visits the Next.js frontend and provides a URL or uploads a README file containing the API documentation.
2.  The user fills out a brief form with basic details for the SDK (e.g., SDK name, version, base URL).
3.  The user initiates the SDK generation process.
4.  The frontend displays progress and, upon completion, allows the user to download the generated TypeScript SDK.

### Core Functionality üõ†Ô∏è
1.  **Documentation Ingestion**: A dedicated agent (working with `Graphlit`) scrapes or reads the provided API documentation, converting it into a structured format.
2.  **API Understanding Agent**: A Google Gemini-powered agent, guided by Agno, analyzes the ingested documentation, identifying API endpoints, methods (GET, POST, etc.), parameters, request/response schemas, and data types.
3.  **SDK Generation Agent**: Another agent, also leveraging Gemini's code generation capabilities and Agno's orchestration, translates the understood API schema into well-structured TypeScript code for the SDK, including type definitions, helper functions, and client methods.
4.  **Orchestration**: Agno intelligently manages the flow between these agents, ensuring proper sequencing, error handling, and robust data transfer to build the SDK piece by piece.
5.  **Backend Logic**: A Python FastAPI backend serves as the bridge between the frontend and the Agno-orchestrated agent system, managing API requests and responses.

### Multimodal Elements ‚úçÔ∏è
*   **Text**: Primary mode, involving ingestion of text-based API documentation and generation of TypeScript code (text).

## Tools Used üß∞

*   **Agent Orchestration**: [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno)
*   **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Google Gemini (via `google-generative-ai`)
*   **Documentation Ingestion**: [Graphlit](https://www.graphlit.com/)
*   **Frontend**: Next.js
*   **Backend**: Python FastAPI
*   **Programming Languages**: TypeScript (for generated SDK), Python (for backend/agents), TypeScript (for frontend)

## UI Approach üñ•Ô∏è

The user interface is a straightforward, single-page web application built with Next.js. It features:
*   A form to input the API documentation source (URL or file upload).
*   Fields for basic SDK configuration details.
*   A progress indicator during SDK generation.
*   A display area for the generated code and a download button for the SDK package.

## Project Structure üìÅ
This submission contains two main components, each in its own sub-folder:

*   `backend/`: Contains the Python FastAPI application that orchestrates the AI agents and handles API requests. For detailed setup and running instructions, refer to its dedicated `backend/README.md`.
*   `frontend/`: Contains the Next.js application that provides the user interface for Type-Scribe AI. For detailed setup and running instructions, refer to its dedicated `frontend/README.md`.

Each sub-folder has its own detailed `README.md` with specific setup, running, and project structure information.

## Getting Started (Setup & Run Instructions) üöÄ
To get Type-Scribe AI up and running, you'll need to set up both the backend and frontend components.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ
*   Python 3.9+ (for backend)
*   Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
